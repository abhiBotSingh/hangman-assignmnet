## Hangman Game

## How To Play The Game

Player has to guess the word by the hint provided. For each incorrect alphabet guessed, a part of the body of hangman appears.
If the complete body of the hangman appears before player could guess the word, he/she will lose the game.
Players can play the game again after winning/losing the game too.
**There might be cases when the game is unable to fetch the word or it's hint, as it relies on extenal endpoints to get them. In such a scenario, player can simply reload the page to get a new word.**
